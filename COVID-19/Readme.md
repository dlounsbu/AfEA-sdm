# COVID-19 Modeling

<b>Preliminary S-E-I-R Model</b>

This is a S-E-I-R model that I built with Stella Architect software for my colleagues at the College Research and Innovation Management (CRIM) Unit, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Time horizon for the model is 1 year (365 days): 2020-03-01 through 2021-02-28. This scenario is based on an initial susceptible population of 7.5 million (estimated population of Oyo State), with Oyo State patient zero assumed to be exposed to COVID-19 on 2020-03-01 (Day 1). Scenarios show effects of a partial lockdown (night curfew) and boarder shutdown. Model structure and parameter values were adapted from https://covidactnow.org/. Major assumptions are that 4% of exposed population will develop mild to moderate symptoms of the disease and that, among these cases, 6% will perish. Please feel free to apply this model to your own local or regional planning efforts.
