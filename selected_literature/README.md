<b>Seminal Textbooks and Selected Readings:</b> In addition to the articles shared here, the <i>System Dynamics Society</i> has compiled a list of important, useful references. See https://sds.memberclicks.net/selected-readings. With members in over 75 countries, the System Dynamics Society provides a strong, unified voice supporting the advancement of System Dynamics. Members are able to stay on top of developments around the world by reading the cutting-edge research and applications of System Dynamics published in the <i>System Dynamics Review</i>, attending the annual conference. Additionally, local <u>Chapters and Special Interest Groups</u> allow for more frequent face-to-face and electronic meetings. See https://www.systemdynamics.org/.

<b>Scriptapedia:</b> Scriptapedia is an introduction to group model building that uses structured small group exercises called scripts. Scriptapedia is intended to be a freely distributed book and easily edited to support the creation of new scripts, discussion of what works and what doesn't, and internationalization of group model building practice. See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scriptapedia.
