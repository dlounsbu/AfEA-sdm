# IAE | Africa Regional Meeting Workshop on System Dynamics Modeling in Epidemiology | Monday | 15-April-2019 | 10:30-13:30 | Maputo, Mozambique

This workshop introduces system dynamics modeling (SDM), a robust systems science methodology still under-used in social and behavioral research, to epidemiologists and public health practitioners. Best practices in SDM design and validation call for the application of a multi-stepped, iterative procedure that engages multiple stakeholders in deliberative problem identification, system conceptualization, model formulation, model simulation, and model evaluation. 

Workshop activities involve hands-on skill building exercises. All participants are encouraged to bring a personal laptop computer to the workshop, pre-installed with a free 20-day trial version of Stella Architect® system dynamics modeling software. 

Learning objectives include: 
1.	Understanding tenets of systems theory in relation to the system dynamics modeling approach
2.	Applying basic concepts of systems thinking: Drawing ‘balancing’ and ‘reinforcing’ loops 
3.	Creating, running and evaluating simple system dynamics models. 

By the end of the workshop, participants will appreciate that system dynamics model building is inherently ‘mixed methods’ research, well-suited to exploring virtually any problem in epidemiology, public health, and medicine.
