# IAE | Africa Regional Meeting Workshop on System Dynamics Modeling in Epidemiology 

Monday | 15-April-2019 | 10:30-13:30 | Eduardo Mondlane Conference Center | Maputo, Mozambique

David W. Lounsbury, PhD | Workshop Facilitator | Albert Einstein College of Medicine | New York USA

This workshop introduces system dynamics modeling (SDM), a robust systems science methodology still under-used in social and behavioral research, to epidemiologists, public health practitioners, nurses and physicians. SDM belongs to the rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field of systems science research. Systems science adds value to more traditional health research by contributing to the design and testing of complex integrated models of change, to improve health system performance and patient outcomes in divserse settings. Best practices in SDM design and validation call for the application of a multi-stepped, iterative procedure that engages multiple stakeholders in deliberative problem identification, system conceptualization, model formulation, model simulation, and model evaluation. 

Workshop activities involve hands-on skill building exercises. All participants are encouraged to bring a personal laptop computer to the workshop, pre-installed with a free 20-day trial version of Stella Architect® system dynamics modeling software. 

Learning objectives include: 
1.	Understanding tenets of systems theory in relation to the system dynamics modeling approach
2.	Applying basic concepts of systems thinking: Drawing ‘balancing’ and ‘reinforcing’ loops 
3.	Creating, running and evaluating simple system dynamics models. 

By the end of the workshop, participants will appreciate that system dynamics model building is inherently ‘mixed methods’ research, well-suited to virtual exploration of complex problems in epidemiology, public health, and medicine.
